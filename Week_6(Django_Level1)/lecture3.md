####Key Assignments
- Ninja Gold (Monday)

#### Models Recap
- Models provide the structure to our database.
- (models are like the skeleton to which the data are attached)
- When we makemigrations we are doing the equivalent of saving our ERD.
- When we migrate we are doing the equivalent of forward engineering. This is the point at which our database is actually created.
- We create custom managers to hold our validations and extend the basic Objects manager.
- All of this is using OOP!
